"""4. E-Commerce Discount Engine


An online shopping platform provides discounts to customers based on their total purchase amount:

* Above ₹5000 → 20% discount
* ₹2000 to ₹5000 → 10% discount
* Below ₹2000 → 5% discount

Write a Python program to calculate the final amount after discount.

Input:
Enter purchase amount: 4500

Output:
Final Amount: ₹4050"""

amt = int(input("Enter the Purchase Amount:"))
if amt > 5000:
	f = amt-(amt * (20/100))
	print("Final Amount:",f)

elif 2000 <= amt <= 5000:
	f = amt-(amt *(10/100))
	print("Final Amount:",f)
else :
	f = amt-(amt *(5/100))
	print("Final Amount:",f)
